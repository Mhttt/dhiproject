# DHI Project

The following application shows all trashcans in Copenhagen.

You can search and filter based on the different districts.

Unfortunately I don't have more time this week to work on the project, so this will be my final implementation.

Even though I would have loved to add more functionalities such as multi filtering and spend time on the design, it has still been very fun so thank you for the opportunity.

As mentioned earlier Typescript and React is my absolute favorite language/library we have used during my studies, and know that this is what I want to work with in the future. I definitely see this job opportunity as great stepping stone towards that direction.
